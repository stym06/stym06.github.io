      <description>This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;m writing something on a blog of my own, guys. I must say that I never knew composing a blog using Markdown was really possible. I had set up so many blogging platforms over the years using every frontend and backend stuff I learned, but as Da Vinci had correctly said:
&amp;ldquo;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&amp;rdquo;
So, here we are, I&amp;rsquo;m using this neat little static site generator called Hugo to build my blog finally.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s when I&amp;rsquo;m in my element. Used to have a grudge against Java, but hey, now we&amp;rsquo;re buddies. And let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about Go, my new partner in crime.
