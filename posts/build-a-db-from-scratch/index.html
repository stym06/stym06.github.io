But we only care about some of it if we get a connection pool failure alert on our pager. We dig a bit and then tune it to fix it there.

  <div class="post-content"><p>Hey folks,
This is the introductory chapter on a series of blogs on how you can build a database from scratch by yourself.</p>
<p>But Why? Why build a database, you ask? There&rsquo;s plenty already. And I only care about the CRUD stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Umm, I guess most of us treat a database as a black box and dump stuff into it. But we only care about some of it if we get a connection pool failure alert on our pager. We dig a bit and then tune it to fix it there. But, to really make the most of your database and most importantly the way you decide if the task requires you to use a SQL or NoSQL one, you gotta see what&rsquo;s the real difference in the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can only happen if you have built one.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some Background<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#some-background">#</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn how a database actually works under the hood. Two things really intrigued me:</p>
<ol>
<li>What the actual <code>INSERT</code> command does. I assumed it must finally be doing some sort of a <code>file.Write()</code> somewhere.</li>
<li>Why are there so many databases out there. What&rsquo;s the fight about SQL vs NoSQL vs Columnar Storage vs KV store. What&rsquo;s the actual difference between an OLTP and an OLAP.</li>
</ol>
<p>I finally decided to dig deep into the internals of it, and bought two books:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em> by Martin Kleppmann: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/</a></li>
<li><em>Database Internals</em> by Alex Petrov: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/database-internals/9781492040330/">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/database-internals/9781492040330/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Watched a lot of CMU videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df-l2PxUidI&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=CMUDatabaseGroup">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df-l2PxUidI&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=CMUDatabaseGroup</a></p>
<p>But at one point, when I started getting bored with the theory, I put my foot down and decided to build one.</p>
<p>How hard could it be, I thought! Well, very much!</p>
<p>The rest of this article is about what really goes inside building a database system. There are a lot of moving parts, all of which work in harmony with each other to finally give you that simple API of <code>db.put(&lt;key&gt;, &lt;value&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see the components of the most popular database, <code>MySQL</code>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Szr4DrM4E8Q/sddefault.jpg" alt="MySQL Architecture"  />
</p>
<p>Looking at it, we have the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li>DB Connectors/Client</li>
<li>SQL Interface API</li>
<li>SQL Parser</li>
<li>Query Optimizer</li>
<li>Buffer Pools</li>
<li>Storage Engines (InnoDB, MyRocks, MyISAM)</li>
<li>File System</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of things under the hood, each with their own share of complexity.</p>
<p>I decided to break this down in a bottom-up fashion, and decided to first understand how the actual data is stored in the end. It must be something, right? Some sort of array maybe or a hashmap or some kind of data structure, right? But how do you store that on a file??</p>

<p>Now that we know a bit about everything, we can dig into the code of the most famous database on the planet:
<em>SQLite</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a reader-friendly version to analyse parts of it:
<a href="https://github.com/davideuler/SQLite-2.5.0-for-code-reading">https://github.com/davideuler/SQLite-2.5.0-for-code-reading</a></p>
